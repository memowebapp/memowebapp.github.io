                        <p><i>Hi, my name is Andrei, and this is a volunteer project with the primary goal of providing an efficient tool for memorizing English irregular verbs. </i></p>
                        <p><b>Who is this app for?</b> I'm expecting that you are already familiar with basic English grammar and particularly with simple past and present perfect tenses. </p>
                        <p><b>How to use?</b> in the tab <i>"Irregular verbs"</i>, you may see a simple past or a past participle sentence where an irregular verb is replaced with a base form and input field. So all you need to do is type the correct form of the verb and press "next" or if you don't know the answer press "help", try to memorize the answer, and press next.</p>
                        <p><b>How does it work?</b> if you didn't know the answer and pressed the button "help", the following sentence with this verb will be shown in a few minutes. Each correct answer will increase the timeout of the next appearance.</p>
                        <p><b>Where these sentences came from?</b> I downloaded around 25000 books with about 15Gb of size from open sources. Then I used a script to find and select sentences with irregular verbs. As sentences were selected automatically it could happen that some of them contain errors or inappropriate words. If you will meet such a sentence, please let me know.</p>
                        <p><b>What is the order of verbs' appearance?</b> verbs were sorted base on citation for instance the verb "was" appears in 1072780 sentences while "sent" only in 14461 sentences. So it makes sense to memorize "was" at first.</p>
